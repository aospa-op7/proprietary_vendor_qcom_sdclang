This is the release of Snapdragon LLVM ARM C/C++ compiler toolchain version
14.1. This is a minor revision update of the toolchain. 

The 14.1 release is available for the following platforms.

1. Linux x64 host running Ubuntu 14.04 or later.
2. Windows x64 host running Windows 7 or later.
3. Linux ARM64 host running Ubuntu 14.04 or later.

The Snapdragon LLVM ARM Compiler will generate code for ARM and X86 targets and
will not generate code for any of the other targets supported by the llvm.org
compiler.

The Snapdragon LLVM ARM 14.1 toolchain includes all changes in the
llvm.org 14.0 release branch, and proprietary features and optimizations
that are not available in the llvm.org 14.0 branch.

The Snapdragon LLVM ARM Compiler uses the integrated assembler for assembling
and includes a full featured proprietary linker (QC Linker) for linking.

The 14.1 release includes all the features in SDLLVM 14.0.3 release as well as additional changes from llvm.org
14.0 branch.However, the 14.1 release does not support advanced pointer authentication feature available in 14.0.3
release since llvm.org 14.0 branch does not support these advanced pointer authentication features. The 14.1 release 
contains support for basic pointer authentication features available in llvm.org 14.0 branch. Code bases relying on 
advanced pointer authentication feature in 14.0.x release should not migrate to 14.1.

Documentation
The complete user guides for this Snapdragon LLVM ARM compiler and linker
are available in the 'documents' directory at the root of the SDLLVM
toolchain, which was downloaded and installed by the Qualcomm Package
Manager (QPM).
